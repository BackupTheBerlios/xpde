Hello All!

I have added some methods of the format " * _k3fb " for compilation VirtualTrees.pas in Kylix 3 Pro. 

For full compilation and installation in IDE I have changed also some more modules:
DmGraphics.pas 		 - remark GetFontList function body
VirtualTreesReg.pas 	 - remark of all editors IDE (ugly hack? - there is no time to rework)
dclVTClx_K3.dpk 	 - remark usage of a package VTClx_K3
dclVTClx_K3.dpk 	 - add Defines: QT_CLX and KYLIX_3 (ugly hack?)
VTClx_K3.dpk 		 - add Defines: QT_CLX and KYLIX_3 (ugly hack?)

If you have problems, or you will need these files, by e-mail: falconsoft@mail.ru
