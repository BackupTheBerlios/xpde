If you installed correctly XPde, you will feel it's a Windows XP with a KDE 3 theme, this is because I can't use any kind of Windows XP graphic, but it's really easy create your own Windows XP theme, check out the xpde/themes/default/32x32 directory to know what images you must create. I'm sure someone will release a Windows XP theme, but in any case, it won't be include on the website because I think it's not legal to use Windows XP icons and graphics.

Now let's see what you can do with this release and what is reproduced:

-The widgets used have been modified to look and behave "exactly" as windows ones
-The system font is Tahoma
-The system colors are the same as Windows XP
-The mouse and hourglass cursor are the Windows XP default
-Use the keyboard on the desktop, cursors to move and enter to open an item
-Right click on the desktop to access some options
-Select the properties option of the desktop menu to show a Desktop Properties dialog
-Set the desktop background image selecting one of a list
-Set the desktop background image browsing your hard disk
-Set the desktop background color
-Set how the background image is drawn on the desktop
-The desktop can hold system icons (My Computer, My Documents, etc), ShortCuts, Folders and Files
-Drag desktop icons to a new location
-Desktop items are aligned to grid
-As you drag desktop icons, they are transparent as in Windows XP
-As you drag a desktop icon, icons under it are selected for operation
-Create shortcuts on the desktop
-Create folders on the desktop
-Open a desktop item using double-click (the explorer is not ready yet, so this is useful to execute shortcuts)
-Associate file extensions with programs using the Open With dialog, this dialog will show when you try to open a file, and the extension is not associated with a program
-All the settings are stored in a .registry dir under your home dir (a registry editor is on the way)
-Desktop locations are also stored on the registry
-The hourglass cursor is set every time you open a program to show a busy state
-Right click on a ShortCut to access some options
-Select the properties option of the Shortcut menu to show a Shortcut properties dialog
-Use the ShortCut properties dialog to change a shortcut icon
-Use the ShortCut properties dialog to see some file properties
-The taskbar holds the current tasks and highlights the selected one (this is not finished, it's really slow now)
-You can click on any task to set the focus to it
-The taskbar has a clock and a start button
-The Start button popups the Start menu
-The Start menu holds all the items and folders of a default Windows XP installation
-Some of them are associated with common Linux executables
-Use the Start | Run command to show the Run dialog and execute any application

Bear in mind this is a beta project, it contain bugs and missing features, but I think is a good start.
